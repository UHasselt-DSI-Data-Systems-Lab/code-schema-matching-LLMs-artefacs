The COHORT_DEFINITION table contains records defining a Cohort derived from the data through the associated description and syntax and upon instantiation (execution of the algorithm) placed into the COHORT table. Cohorts are a set of subjects that satisfy a given combination of inclusion criteria for a duration of time. The COHORT_DEFINITION table provides a standardized structure for maintaining the rules governing the inclusion of a subject into a cohort, and can store operational programming code to instantiate the cohort within the OMOP Common Data Model.
